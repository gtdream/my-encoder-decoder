UTF-8은 유니코드를 위한 가변 길이 문자 인코딩 방식 중 하나로, 켄 톰프슨과 롭 파이크가 만들었다. 본래는 FSS-UTF(File System Safe UCS/Unicode Transformation Format)라는 이름으로 제안되었다.
UTF-8 인코딩은 유니코드 한 문자를 나타내기 위해 1바이트에서 4바이트까지를 사용한다. 예를 들어서, U+0000부터 U+007F 범위에 있는 ASCII 문자들은 UTF-8에서 1바이트만으로 표시된다. 4바이트로 표현되는 문자는 모두 기본 다국어 평면(BMP) 바깥의 유니코드 문자이며, 거의 사용되지 않는다. UTF-16과 UTF-8 중 어느 인코딩이 더 적은 바이트를 사용하는지는 문자열에서 사용된 코드 포인트에 따라 달라지며, 실제로 DEFLATE와 같은 일반적인 압축 알고리즘을 사용할 경우 이 차이는 무시할 수 있을 정도이다. 이러한 압축 알고리즘을 사용하기 힘들고 크기가 중요할 경우 유니코드 표준 압축 방식을 대신 사용할 수 있다.

구조 [편집]

UTF-8은 여러 표준 문서에서 다른 방법으로 정의되어 있지만, 일반적인 구조는 모두 동일하다.
유니코드 코드 포인트를 나타내는 비트들은 여러 부분으로 나뉘어서, UTF-8로 표현된 바이트의 하위 비트들에 들어 간다. U+007F까지의 문자는 7비트 ASCII 문자와 동일한 방법으로 표시되며, 그 이후의 문자는 다음과 같은 4바이트까지의 비트 패턴으로 표시된다. 7비트 ASCII 문자와 혼동되지 않게 하기 위하여 모든 바이트들의 최상위 비트는 1이다.
코드 범위
(십육진법)	UTF-16BE 표현
(이진법)	UTF-8 표현
(이진법)	설명
000000-00007F	00000000 0xxxxxxx	0xxxxxxx	ASCII와 동일한 범위
000080-0007FF	00000xxx xxxxxxxx	110xxxxx 10xxxxxx	첫 바이트는 110 또는 1110으로 시작하고, 나머지 바이트들은 10으로 시작함
000800-00FFFF	xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx	1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
010000-10FFFF	110110yy yyxxxxxx 110111xx xxxxxxxx	11110zzz 10zzxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx	UTF-16 서러게이트 쌍 영역 (yyyy = zzzzz - 1). UTF-8로 표시된 비트 패턴은 실제 코드 포인트와 동일하다.
예를 들어서, 문자 "위"(U+C704)는 다음과 같은 방법으로 UTF-8로 인코딩된다.
이 문자는 U+0800부터 U+FFFF 사이의 영역에 있으므로, 표에 따라 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 형식으로 인코딩된다.
16진수 C704는 2진수 1100-0111-0000-0100와 같다.
이 비트들은 순서대로 x로 표시된 비트에 들어 간다: 11101100 10011100 10000100
결과적으로 이 문자는 3바이트로 인코딩되며, 16진수로 표시하면 EC 9C 84가 된다.
따라서 첫 128 문자는 1바이트로 표시되고, 그 다음 1920 문자 — 발음 구별 기호가 붙은 라틴 문자, 그리스 문자, 키릴 문자, 콥트 문자, 아르메니아 문자, 히브리 문자, 아랍 문자 — 는 2바이트로 표시되며, 나머지 문자들 중 BMP 안에 들어 있는 것은 3바이트, 아닌 것은 4바이트로 표시된다.
위의 패턴을 사용하면 더 큰 코드 포인트를 표시할 수도 있다. 원래 UTF-8은 6바이트를 사용해서 U+7FFFFFFF까지의 코드 포인트를 표현할 수 있게 하였으나, 2003년 11월에 발표된 RFC 3629에서는 유니코드에서 실제로 정의하는 U+10FFFF까지의 문자만을 표시할 수 있도록 제한하였다. 따라서 이전까지는 UTF-8에서 나타날 수 없는 바이트가 0xFE와 0xFF 뿐이었지만, RFC 3629에 따라서 0xC0, 0xC1, 그리고 0xF5부터 0xFF까지의 13개의 바이트가 나타날 수 없게 되었다.
변형된 UTF-8 [편집]

자바는 내부적으로 문자열을 UTF-16 인코딩으로 저장하며, 문자열 직렬화를 위하여 UTF-8을 변형하여 사용하고 있다. 이를 변형된 UTF-8이라 부른다.
표준 UTF-8과의 차이는 크게 두 가지로, 한 가지는 U+0000을 1바이트가 아니라 2바이트, 즉 11000000 10000000으로 표현하는 것이다. 따라서 수정된 UTF-8에서는 인코딩된 문자열에 널 문자가 나타나지 않게 되며, 따라서 널 문자를 문자열의 끝으로 사용하는 C와 같은 언어에서 처리할 때 문자열이 잘리는 것을 막을 수 있다.
다른 한 가지 차이는 BMP 바깥의 문자를 인코딩하는 방법이다. 표준 UTF-8에서는 이 문자들은 위와 같이 4바이트로 인코딩되지만, 수정된 UTF-8에서는 이 문자들을 surrogate pair로 표시하여 두 문자로 나눈 뒤 같은 방법으로 인코딩한다. (이는 CESU-8과 동일하다) 이러한 방법은 자바의 문자 형이 16비트 크기이며, 따라서 U+10000 이상의 영역에 속한 유니코드 문자는 항상 두 개의 자바 문자로 표현되어야 한다는 것에서 유래하였다. 하지만 이 방법은 BMP 바깥의 문자를 UTF-8보다 더 긴 6바이트로 인코딩해야 한다.
이러한 차이 때문에 이 인코딩은 UTF-8과 엄격하게 구별해야 하며, 자바에서 내부적인 처리에만 사용하도록 권장된다. 또한 UTF-8과는 달리 IANA에 정식으로 등록된 문자 인코딩이 아니므로 인터넷 상의 정보 교환을 위해 사용하지 않아야 한다.
UTF-8의 설계 원칙 [편집]

그 구조로부터, UTF-8이 다음과 같은 성질을 가지고 있다는 것을 알 수 있다.
1바이트로 표시된 문자의 최상위 비트는 항상 0이다.
2바이트 이상으로 표시된 문자의 경우, 첫 바이트의 상위 비트들이 그 문자를 표시하는 데 필요한 바이트 수를 결정한다. 예를 들어서 2바이트는 110으로 시작하고, 3바이트는 1110으로 시작한다.
첫 바이트가 아닌 나머지 바이트들은 상위 2비트가 항상 10이다.
UTF-8이 이런 성질을 가지도록 설계한 까닭은 어떤 경우에도 한 문자에 대한 바이트 표현이 다른 문자에 대한 바이트 표현의 일부가 되는 경우가 없도록 하기 위함이다. 따라서 텍스트 안에 들어 있는 다른 텍스트를 찾는 데 쓰이는 바이트 단위의 부문자열 매칭이 UTF-8 문자열에서도 쓰일 수 있다. 통합 완성형, Shift JIS, Big5과 같이 ISO 2022 체계에 부합하지 않는 이전의 가변 길이 인코딩은 그런 성질을 지니지 않았고 (기존 인코딩 가운데 EUC-KR이나 EUC-JP 등은 이 점에서는 UTF-8과 비슷한 성질을 지닌다.), 더 복잡한 알고리즘을 써야 했다. 왜냐하면, 이들 인코딩은 ASCII 영역의 글자를 나타내는 바이트를 2바이트로 나타내는 다른 글자의 두 번째 바이트로 사용하기 때문이다. 또한, UTF-8에서 하나 이상의 바이트들이 손실되었을 때도, 다음의 정상 문자를 찾아서 동기화할 수 있기 때문에 피해를 줄일 수 있다.
그 설계 때문에 어떤 바이트들이 올바른 UTF-8로 확인되면, 그 문자열이 실제로 UTF-8로 인코딩되었을 가능성이 매우 높다. 임의의 바이트들이 순수한 ASCII 인코딩이 아닌 UTF-8 문자열일 가능성은 2바이트 문자의 경우 1/32, 3바이트 문자의 경우 5/256으로 매우 낮다. 또한 ISO-8859-1과 같은 기존의 인코딩으로 표현된 자연어 문자열이나 문서를 UTF-8로 표현된 것으로 오인할 가능성도 매우 낮다.
오류 처리 [편집]

잘못된 입력이 들어 왔을 때 UTF-8 디코더가 해야 할 동작은 표준들에 일정하게 정의되어 있지 않다. 일반적으로 이러한 경우에 디코더가 취할 수 있는 동작은 다음과 같을 수 있다.
U+003F(?, 물음표)나 U+FFFD(�, 유니코드 대치 문자) 같은 다른 문자를 집어 넣는다.
해당 바이트들을 무시한다.
해당 바이트들을 다른 인코딩으로 해석한다.
오류로 처리하지 않고 UTF-8과 비슷한 형식으로 취급하여 디코딩한다. (이러한 동작은 디코더의 버그일 수도 있다)
오류를 보고한다.
또한 디코더들은 다른 잘못된 입력에 대해서 다른 동작을 보일 수 있다.
RFC 3629에서는 UTF-8 디코더들이 ‘너무 긴 형식’, 즉 해당 문자를 표현하는 데 필요한 최소의 바이트보다 더 많은 바이트를 사용해서 표현한 바이트들을 잘못된 입력으로 처리해야 한다고 요구하고 있다. 유니코드 표준에서는 유니코드를 따르는 디코더가 ‘잘못된 형식으로 표현된 모든 단위 문자열을 오류로 처리하고, 따라서 잘못된 형식으로 표현된 단위 문자열을 해석하거나 생성해 내서는 안 된다’라고 요구하고 있다.
모든 가능한 해석은 장단점을 가지고 있으며, 만약 UTF-8을 해석하기 전에 검증이 이루어질 경우 보안 관련해서 주의가 요구된다.
너무 긴 형식은 처리하기 곤란한 경우 중 하나이다. 현재의 RFC에는 이러한 형식이 디코드되어서는 안 된다고 규정하고 있지만, 옛 UTF-8 표준에는 경고만 하였으며 대부분의 간단한 디코더들은 이러한 데이터를 정상적으로 해석한다. 이 형식은 실제로는 같은 코드 포인트를 서로 다른 두 개의 UTF-8 문자열로 나타내어 마이크로소프트의 IIS 웹 서버와 같은 제품의 보안 검증을 우회하는 데 사용되었다.
잘못된 입력이 들어 왔을 때 보안을 지키기 위해서는 두 가지 선택이 있다. 한 가지는 입력을 검증하기 전에 항상 UTF-8로부터 디코드하는 것이며, 다른 한 가지는 잘못된 입력을 언제나 오류로 처리하는 엄격한 디코더를 사용하는 것이다.
장점과 단점 [편집]

일반적으로 [편집]
장점
ASCII 인코딩은 UTF-8의 부분 집합이다. 일반적인 ASCII 문자열은 올바른 UTF-8 문자열이며, 따라서 하위 호환성이 보장된다.
UTF-8 문자열은 바이트 단위로 정렬을 수행하는 알고리즘으로도 코드 포인트 단위로 올바르게 정렬할 수 있다. (일반적인 목적으로는 재정렬이 필요하다)
UTF-8과 UTF-16은 XML 문서의 표준 인코딩으로, 다른 인코딩들을 사용하려면 외부에서, 또는 문서 안에서 명시적으로 인코딩을 정해야 한다. [1]
다른 인코딩과의 왕복 변환이 간단하다.
바이트 단위 문자열 검색 알고리즘들을 그대로 사용할 수 있다.
간단한 알고리즘을 통하여 UTF-8 문자열임을 확인할 수 있다. 즉, 다른 인코딩에서 나타나는 바이트들이 올바른 UTF-8 문자열일 가능성은 낮다.
U+0000을 표현할 때를 제외하면, 널 문자는 UTF-8 문자열 안에 나타나지 않는다. 따라서 널 문자로 끝나는 문자열을 사용하는 C 언어의 문자열 함수(strncpy() 같은)를 그대로 사용할 수 있다.
단점
나쁘게 만들어진(그리고 현재 표준을 따르지 않는) UTF-8 파서는 서로 다른 가짜 UTF-8 표현(예를 들어서 너무 긴 형식)을 같은 유니코드 문자열로 해석할 수 있다.
기존의 인코딩들과 비교했을 때 [편집]
장점
UTF-8은 모든 유니코드 문자를 표현할 수 있다. 예를 들어서, UCS-2는 BMP 안의 문자만을 표현할 수 있다.
바이트 경계를 순서대로 혹은 역순으로 찾기 쉽다. 만약 여러 바이트로 표시된 문자의 중간에서 찾기 시작한다면, 단지 해당 문자만 손실되고 나머지 문자들은 손상을 입지 않는다. 기존의 많은 다중바이트 인코딩들은 이러한 재동기화가 훨씬 힘들다.
한 문자를 표현하는 바이트 표현은 다른 문자를 표현하는 어떤 바이트 표현에도 포함되지 않는다. 따라서 ASCII 문자가 아닌 값들에 투명한 파일 시스템이나 다른 소프트웨어(예를 들어서 C의 printf() 함수)와 호환성을 가진다.
바이트 표현의 첫 바이트만 사용하여 해당 바이트 표현의 길이를 결정할 수 있다. 따라서 부분 문자열을 얻는 과정이 매우 쉽다.
인코딩에 간단한 비트 연산만 사용되므로 효과적이다. UTF-8은 곱셈이나 나눗셈과 같은 느린 연산들을 사용하지 않는다.
단점
대부분의 UTF-8 문자열은 일반적으로 적당한 기존 인코딩으로 표현한 문자열보다 더 크다. 판독 기호를 사용하는 대부분의 라틴 알파벳 문자는 적어도 2바이트를 사용하며, 한중일 문자들과 표의 문자들은 적어도 3바이트를 사용한다.
한중일 문자들과 표의 문자를 제외한 거의 모든 기존 인코딩들은 한 문자에 1바이트를 사용하므로 문자열 처리가 간편한 반면, UTF-8은 그렇지 않다.
UTF-7과 비교했을 때 [편집]
장점
UTF-8은 한 문자를 표현하는 데 UTF-7보다 더 적은 바이트들을 사용한다.
UTF-8은 "+"를 그대로 인코딩하지만 UTF-7은 "+-"로 인코딩한다.
단점
UTF-8은 8비트 안전한 전송 체계가 필요하다. 전자 우편에서 quoted-printable이나 base64 인코딩을 사용한다면 전송량이 더 많아진다. 예를 들어서 base64 인코딩의 경우 인코딩된 결과는 원본보다 약 33% 더 커진다. 하지만 최근에는 대부분의 SMTP 서버가 8BITMIME을 지원하기 때문에 이런 단점은 크게 부각되지 않는다.
UTF-16과 비교했을 때 [편집]
장점
U+0000부터 U+007F까지의 공백과 문장 부호를 포함한 ASCII 문자들은 1바이트로 표현할 수 있기 때문에, 한중일 문자와 표의 문자를 사용하지 않는 대부분의 문자열을 UTF-16보다 더 작은 크기로 표현할 수 있다.
유닉스의 파일 시스템과 여러 도구들은 옥텟을 기본 단위로 하며, 널 문자와 경로 식별자(/, 0x2F)에 특별한 의미를 부여하는 경우가 많다. 0x00이나 0x2f 옥텟이 U+0000과 U+002F가 아닌 다른 문자에서도 나타날 수 있는 UTF-16 등의 인코딩과는 달리, UTF-8은 ASCII와 호환되기 때문에 0x00이나 0x2f 옥텟이 항상 U+0000과 U+002F에 대응되므로 기존 API를 약간 수정해서 쓸 수 있다.
UTF-16은 바이트 순서를 나타내기 위하여 바이트 순서 문자(BOM, U+FEFF)가 필요하지만, UTF-8은 바이트 순서가 정해져 있기 때문에 BOM이 필요하지 않다.
단점
UTF-8은 가변 길이 인코딩이며, 다른 문자는 다른 바이트 수로 표현될 수 있다. 사실 이 문제는 별로 심각한 것이 아니며, UTF-8 문자열을 다루기 위한 추상적인 인터페이스를 만드는 것으로 해결될 수 있다. 실제로 기술적으로는 UTF-16도 BMP 바깥 문자를 4바이트로 표현하기 때문에 가변 길이 인코딩이다.
BMP에 들어 있는 한중일 문자들은 UTF-8에서 3바이트로 표현되지만, UTF-16에서는 2바이트로 표현된다. 따라서 UTF-8에서는 이러한 문자를 표현하기 위하여 더 많은 바이트가 필요하며 UTF-16과 비교할 때 최대 50%까지 크기가 늘 수 있다. 하지만 반대로 U+0000부터 U+007F 사이의 글자들은 UTF-16에서 크기가 두 배로 늘기 때문에 실질적으로는 큰 문제가 없을 수도 있다.

UTF-16(16-bit Unicode Transformation Format)은 유니코드 문자 인코딩 방식의 하나이다. 주로 사용되는 기본 다국어 평면 (BMP, Basic multilingual plane)에 속하는 문자들은 그대로 16비트 값으로 인코딩이 되고 그 이상의 문자는 특별히 정해진 방식으로 32비트로 인코딩이 된다.
UTF-16은 유니코드 컨소시움과 ISO/IEC 10646에 의해 정의되어 있다. 유니코드는 거기에 추가적인 내용을 정하고 있다. 정확한 차이점은 유니코드 4.0 표준의 부록편 C 부분이 자세히 기술되어 있다. ISO 표준은 UCS-2 인코딩도 정의하며 여기선 BMP의 16비트 표현만을 다룬다.
기본 다국어 평면은 U+0000 에서 U+FFFF 에 놓인 문자를 담고 있다. 이 영역에는 우리가 쉽게 생각할 수 있는 문자들이 포함되며, 한글, 한자 등은 모두 여기에 포함되어 있다. 이 영역에는 서러게이트 문자(surrogate)들이 준비되어 있어 16비트 이상의 문자를 표현할 때를 대비해 놓았다.
기본 다국어 평면의 문자들은 곧바로 16비트 값으로 대응되어 인코딩되며, 이 경우에는 인코딩된 바이트 스트링의 엔디언만 조심하면 된다.

기본 다국어 평면에 포함되지 않는 문자들, 즉 16비트로 값을 표현할 수 없는 문자들은 서러게이트(Surrogate) 문자 영역에 해당하는 두 개의 16비트 문자로 변환되어 이 한 쌍(즉 32비트)이 그 문자를 나타내게 된다. 그 자세한 방식은 다음 그림을 통해 설명한다.

유니코드 문자 영역에서 상위 서러게이트는 U+D800 에서 U+DBFF 까지의 값을 갖는다. 즉 최상위비트 6개의 값이 그림에서 보듯이 110110 으로 일정하다. 마찬가지로 하위 서러게이트는 U+DC00 에서 U+DFFF 까지의 값을 가지며 최상위비트 6개의 값은 110111 이 된다. 각 서러게이트 문자는 하위 10비트씩의 자유도를 갖는다. 따라서 주어진 문자를 10비트씩 두조각을 내서 상위 서러게이트와 하위 서러게이트에 배정한 것이다.
여기서 다음을 만족한다.
ZZZZ=zzzzz-1.
이 방법으로 UTF-16 인코딩이 가능한 유니코드 문자의 범위가 나온다.
zzzzz=00000 이라면, 문자는 16비트 이하로 표현이 가능하다. 즉, U+00xxxx 그대로 대응되는 값을 써주면 된다. 그렇지 않다면, ZZZZ=0000..1111 이 되며,zzzz=00001..10000 = U+01xxxx .. U+10xxxx
이 두 개의 서러게이트 문자는 상위 서러게이트, 하위 서러게이트로서 전송이 된다. 이 방법으로 U+10FFFF 까지의 문자를 인코딩 할 수 있다.

사람과의 크기 비교
보리고래(학명: balaenoptera borealis)는 수염고래의 한 종류이며 대왕고래와 큰고래에 이어 3번째로 큰 고래이다.[3] 일어명을 직역해 멸치고래또는 정어리고래라고도 한다. 전 세계의 대양과 인접한 바다에 발견되지만 주로 수심이 깊은 곳을 선호한다.[4] 극지방, 열대지방, 내해지방에서는 잘 발견되지 않는다. 보리고래는 해마다 차가운 지방에서 온대지방이나 아열대지방으로 이동하지만, 이동경로는 대부분이 알려진 바가 없다.[5]
보리고래의 몸길이는 최대 20m이며 몸무게는 최대 45t이다.[5] 일일당 먹이 섭취량은 평균 900kg에 달하며 주식은 크릴새우, 동물성 플랑크톤 등이다.[6] 고래 중에서 가장 빠른 편에 속하는데, 단거리에서는 최대 이동속도 50km/시까지 이를 수 있다.[6] ‘보리고래’라는 이름은 이 고래가 보리가 익는 시기에 나타난다고 붙은 이름이라고 한다.[1] 영어를 포함한 많은 유럽권 언어에서 보리고래의 이름에 ‘sei’라는 말이 붙는데, 이는 노르웨이어로 대구를 부르는 말로, 이들이 해마다 같은 때에 함께 나타난다고 해서 붙은 이름이다.[7]
19세기 후반에서 20세기 후반까지 진행된 대규모 고래잡이에서 238,000마리가 포획되었으며,[8] 현재는 국제적으로 보호를 받고 있는 종이지만,[2] 명목상 연구 목적으로 아이슬란드와 일본에 의해 소량의 개체가 포획되고는 한다.[9] 2006년의 개체수 추산치는 54,000마리로 대규모 포경 전 개체수의 20% 수준이다.[7]

보리고래와 다른 수염고래와의 관계를 나타내는 그림 (빨간색이 보리고래)
르네프림베르 레송에 의해서 1828년에 설명되었지만 추가 설명은 칼 루돌피에 의해 추가되었으며 이에 따라 루돌피수염고래라고 불리기도 하였다.
영문 이름 부분 중 sei는 대구를 뜻하며, 둘이 플랑크톤을 먹을 때 같이 나타난다고 붙은 이름이다.[7] 아시아의 일본에서는 정어리와 같이 나타난다고 하여 ‘이와시 쿠지라’(직역하면 정어리고래)라고 일컬어지며,[10] 이는 한국어로 번역되어 종종 쓰이기도 한다. 보리고래라는 이름은 울산지역에서 보리를 수확할 즈음에 나타난다고 붙은 이름이다.[1]
보리고래는 수염고래이며, 이는 흑고래, 대왕고래, 브라이드 고래, 큰고래, 그리고 쇠정어리고래를 포함한다. 수염고래는 공통적으로 목주름과 수염이 있다. 수염고래들은 수염고래아목의 다른 종과 중신세에 들어 갈라선 것으로 여겨진다.[11]
두 가지의 아종이 확인되었다. 하나는 북방보리고래(Balaenoptera borealis borealis)이며, 다른 하나는 남방보리고래이다(Balaenoptera borealis schleglii).[12] 이 두가지 아종은 고립되어 있으며, 서로 어울리는 일은 없다.
외관과 행동 방식 [편집]

보리고래는 대왕고래, 큰고래에 이어 3번째로 큰 대왕고래속의 종이다.[3] 성숙한 개체의 몸길이는 12에서 15m이며,[6] 몸무게는 20에서 30t 정도이다. 남방아종이 북방아종보다 큰 편이며 또한 수컷보다 암컷이 큰 편이다.[5] 가장 큰 보리고래는 20m였으며[6] 몸무게는 40에서 45t 사이였다. 가장 큰 보리고래는 아이슬란드에서 포획된 것으로 몸길이 16미터였다.[13] 갓 태어난 새끼의 몸길이는 4에서 5미터 정도이다.[6]
이들의 몸색깔은 어두운 쇠색이며 복부분에는 불규칙적인 연회색에서 흰색의 점이 있다. 목에는 32에서 60개의 주름이 있으며, 이는 먹이를 먹을 때 입이 팽창하도록 도와주는 역할을 한다. 주둥이는 뾰족한 편이며 가슴지느러미는 다른 고래에 비해 짧고 뾰족한 편으로, 몸길이의 9-10% 정도밖에 되지 않는다.[7] 주둥이의 끝에서 숨구멍까지 줄이 그어져 있으며, 이는 수염고래들의 공통적인 특징이다.
이들의 피부는 구멍이나 상처가 있을 수도 있으며, 치유된 후에는 희게 변한다. 이는 요각류,[14], 칠성장어,[15] 심지어는 작은 상어[16] 같은 기생체에 의한 것이다. 주둥이에서 끝의 2/3 정도 위치에 있는 등지느러미는 낫과 같은 모양이며 높이는 25에서 61센티미터 정도이다. 보리고래 각 개체를 확인하는 데에는 등지느러미모양, 몸색깔, 흉터들이 쓰이고 있다.[17] 꼬리는 두꺼우며, 꼬리지느러미는 몸크기에 비해서 작은 편이다.[7]


고래수염을 자세히 본 것. 플랑크톤과 같은 작은 먹이를 걸러내는 데에 쓰인다.
이 수염고래는 먹이를 걸러 먹는 종이며, 많은 양의 바닷물의 머금어 고래수염을 이용해 먹이를 걸러내고 바닷물은 뺀다. 성체는 양쪽에 각각 300에서 380개의 수염판이 있으며, 각 길이는 48센티미터 정도이다. 수염판은 끝에서 고운 털로 자라나 혀에 이르는 손톱과 같은 케라틴질로 이루어져 있다.[6] 보리고래의 0.1밀리미터정도의 아주 고운 강모는 이들을 다른 수염고래로부터 구별할 수 있는 특징이기도 하다.[18]
보리고래는 다른 대형 수염고래와 비슷하게 생겼다. 수염을 보지 않고 브라이드고래와 구분할 때는 머리의 등줄기의 유무 여부가 사용된다 (보리고래는 없다). 큰 보리고래는 큰고래와 혼동될 수도 있다. 하지만 큰고래의 특징인 비대칭적 머리 채색과 흰 밑턱, 회색인 왼쪽로 구분될 수 있다. 옆에서 보면 보리고래의 머리에는 주둥이와 눈 사이에 작은 아치 모양이 있으며, 큰고래의 경우는 대체로 평평하다.[5]
보리고래는 대체로 혼자서 다니지만,[19] 6마리씩 무리를 지어다니기도 한다.[17] 이보다 더 큰 무리는 먹이가 풍부한 지역에서 발생한다. 이들의 사회구조에 대해서 알려진 것은 거의 없다. 수컷과 암컷은 유대감을 형성하기도 하지만, 이를 확증하는 연구는 부족한 편이다.[3][20]
보리고래는 고래 중 가장 빠른 편이다. 최대속도는 단거리에서 50킬로미터/시에 이른다.[6] 이에 반해 오래 잠수할 수 있는 편은 아니며, 얕은 바다에 5분에서 15분 가량 머무는 데에 그친다. 수면에 몇 분 동안 머물러 있을 때 잔잔하고 깨끗한 바다에서 보이며 40초마다 한 번씩 고래분수를 뿜기도 한다. 큰고래와 달리 보리고래는 잠수시에 몸을 높게 들어올리지는 않는다. 숨구멍과 등지느러미는 수면에 동시에 노출되어 있다. 보리고래는 수면에 꼬리를 거의 드러내지 않으며, 고래뛰기를 하지도 않는다.[5]
먹이 [편집]


보리고래의 주식인 크릴무리의 사진 — 새우같이 생겼다.
보리고래는 해수면 가까이서 먹이를 먹으며, 먹이가 모여 있는 곳에 몸을 기울여 이들을 하루에 평균 900킬로그램정도의 먹이를 잡는다.[6] 육중한 무게와 크기에도 불구하고 이들의 먹이인 동물성플랑크톤과 작은 물고기가 주로 먹이사슬의 하위단계에 있는 것은 주목할 만할 일이다. 이들이 동물성플랑크톤을 선호하는 것은 내장의 내용물 분석결과와 먹이를 머금는 장면의 관찰로 인해 밝혀졌다.[21][22] 주식은 보리고래의 옅은 갈색 구름과 같은 변을 채집함에 따라서도 밝혀졌다. 망에 변을 모아 수중에 있는 유전물질과 분리해 알려져 있는 종의 것들과 비교되었다.[23] 보리고래는 정어리류, 돌묵상어, 참고래와 먹이를 놓고 경쟁하는 것으로 나타났다.
북대서양 보리고래의 주식은 Calanus finmarchicus라는 종의 동물성플랑크톤이며, 크릴은 제2의 식단이다.[24][25] 북태평양 보리고래의 식단도 이와 비슷하며, 먹이가 되는 플랑크톤은 Calanus cristatus, Calanus plumchrus, Calanus pacificus, Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa inermis, Thysanoessa longipes, Thysanoessa spinifera 등이다. 이에 더해서 오징어 같이 플랑크톤보다 더 큰 종을 먹기도 한다.[26] 또한 멸치나 고등어를 먹기도 한다.[24][27] 보리고래가 먹는 몇몇 어류종은 상업적으로 중요한 어획종이다. 중부 캘리포니아에서 이들이 6월과 8월 사이에는 안초비, 9월과 10월 사이에는 크릴을 먹는 것이 확인되었다.[15] 남반구에서 이들이 먹는 종은 Calanus tonsus, Calanus simillimus, Drepanopus pectinatus, Euphausia superba, Euphausia vallentini 등이다.[24]
생애 [편집]
짝짓기는 온대, 아열대지방에서 겨울에 하며, 추정 임신기간은 10 3/4개월,[28] 11 1/4 개월,[29] 1년,[30] 으로 다양하며, 이러한 차이는 태아의 성장을 측정할 때 사용되는 다양한 모형 때문이다. 임신기간 추정치의 다양함은 이들의 임신기간 동안 관찰을 계속할 수 없다는 것도 한몫 한다. 그래서 보리고래를 비롯한 수염고래의 임신기간에 대한 자료는 상업적 고래잡이 업자들에게서 나온다. 이러한 자료를 바탕으로 연구자들은 여러 태아의 크기와 특징을 갓 태어난 새끼와 비교해 수태기를 측정하려고 한다.
갓 태어난 새끼는 몸길이 11-12미터로 태어난 후 6-9개월 후 젖을 떼며,[28] 따라서 젖떼기는 북방지에서 여름이나 가을에 일어난다. 암컷은 2년 또는 3년마다 한 번씩 번식하며,[28] 동시에 6마리까지 낳은 경우도 있지만, 보통은 한 번에 1마리만을 출산한다.[6] 성적으로 성숙하기까지는 8에서 10년이 걸리며,[28] 성장 완료 후 수컷의 몸길이는 12미터이며, 암컷의 경우는 13미터이다.[7] 보리고래의 최대수명은 65년이다.[31]
노래 [편집]
 이 부분의 본문은 고래의 노래입니다.
다른 고래들처럼 보리고래 또한 길고, 음량이 큰 주파수의 낮은 소리를 내는 것으로 알려져있다. 이들이 사용하는 신호는 상대적으로 알려진 바가 거의 없지만, 2003년에 남극반도에서 보리고래가 만든 "짖는 소리", "휙 소리"같은 신호가 관측된 바가 있다.[32] 많은 신호는 각 부분 사이에 주파수가 달랐다. 이러한 조합은 보리고래의 신호를 다른 고래의 것에서부터 구분할 수 있는 특징이다. 대부분의 신호는 0.5초 동안 지속되며, 주파수는 인간이 대부분 들을 수 있는 240-635HZ였다. 기록된 것들 중 가장 큰 음향을 지닌 것은 1미터 거리에서 156dB로 측정되었다.[32]
서식지와 회유 경로 [편집]



2001년 9월 17일에 발행된 페로산 우표에 그려져 있는 보리고래
보리고래는 전 세계의 대양에서 서식하지만, 극지방과 열대 바다에서는 잘 발견되지 않는다.[5] 보리고래를 브라이드 고래나 가끔 큰고래와 혼동하는 사태가 많음에 따라 이들의 분포 범위와 개체수 측정에 혼란을 주기도 하였다.
북대서양에서 보리고래는 동부에서는 남유럽에서 노르웨이까지, 서부에서는 남부미국에서 그린란드까지 서식한다.[4] 확증된 가장 남한계 기록은 멕시코 만 북부와 안틸레스 제도였다.[18] 이들은 멕시코 만, 세인트로렌스 만, 허드슨 만, 북해, 지중해 등 육지에 둘러싸인 바다는 피하는 경향이 있다.[5] 보리고래는 깊은 바다에 주로 살며, 대륙붕 사면[33] 해저분지,[34] 또는 해저계곡과 같은 지역에서 발견된다.[35]
북태평양에서 보리고래는 겨울에는 북위 20-23도의 바다에 사며, 여름에는 35-50도의 지역에 서식한다.[36] 대략 전체 북태평양보리고래 75%가량은 날짜변경선의 동쪽에 살지만,[8] 북태평양에서 전반적인 분포에 대한 자료는 부족하다. 캘리포니아에서 추적장치를 부착한 두 개체는 나중에 워싱턴 주와 브리티시 컬럼비아에서 발견되었다.[37] 남반구에서는 과거의 포획 기록을 보아 하계 서식지역은 남위 40-50도로 추정되지만, 겨울의 서식지는 알려져 있지 않다.[24]
대개 보리고래는 여름은 한대 및 극지방 인근 지역에서 보내고, 여름에는 먹이가 풍부한 온대및 아열대지방으로 이동한다.[5] 대서양 북서지역에서 관찰및 포획 기록은 이 지역의 보리고래가 북쪽을 따라 조지스 해구, 메인 만에 6월 말에 도착하는 것으로 알려져 있다. 뉴펀들랜드의 남해안에서는 8월에서 9월까지 목격되며, 남방지역으로의 회유는 9월 중순에서 11월 중순에 노바스코샤를 따라 시작된다. 래브라도 해에 6월 첫째 주에 도착한 개체는 그린란드를 향해 더 북쪽으로 가기도 한다.[38] 대서양 북동 지역에서 보리고래는 서아프리카에서 여름을 보내며, 봄에는 대륙붕을 따라 북상을 시작한다. 큰 암컷이 북상을 이끄며 덴마크 해협에 수컷이나 작은 개체보다 더 빠르게 도착하며, 그 지역에 7월 중순에서 9월 중순까지 남아 있다. 어떠한 해에는 수컷이나 어린 개체는 여름에 저위도지방에 남아 있기도 하였다.[13]
이들의 회유 방식에 대해 어느 정도 알려지기는 하였지만, 정확한 회유 경로는 알려진 바가 없으며,[13] 과학자들은 해마다 무리가 어디가 나타날지 정확하게 예측할 수 없다. 어떠한 위치에서는 한 해는 개체수가 많다가 다른 몇 년 동안은 단 한 마리도 나타나지 않기도 한다.[39] F.O.카펠은 그린란드 서쪽에서 나타나는 보리고래와 따뜻한 북대서양해류와의 관계를 주목하였다.[40] 여러 개체에 추적 장치를 부착한 결과 이들은 해마다 아이슬란드에 돌아오는 것으로 밝혀졌다.[41]
고래잡이 [편집]

고래작살
폭발하는 고래작살과 19세기에 이르러서 증기선이 발명되자 상업적 고래잡이 업자들이 이전에는 잡고 회수하기 어려웠던 대형 고래들을 잡을 수 있게 되었다. 이들의 빠른 속도와 민첩함,[42] 상대적으로 적은 고래 기름과 고기 때문에 초기에는 널리 선호되지 않았다. 상업적 고래잡이 업자들이 선호하던 참고래, 대왕고래, 큰고래, 혹고래들이 고갈되자 특히 1950년대에서 1970년대까지 보리고래가 대신 포획되기 시작하였다.[3]
북대서양 [편집]
북대서양에서는 1885년과 1984년 사이에는 보리고래 14,295마리가 잡혔다.[8] 19세기 말과 20세기 초에 노르웨이와 스코틀랜드 연안에서 잡히기 시작했으며[39] 1885년 한 해만 핀마크에서 700마리 이상이 처리되었다.[43] 보리고래 고기는 당시 노르웨이에서 인기 있었지만, 20세기 초기에는 포획량이 많지 않아 경제성이 낮았다.[44]
아이슬란드의 한 처리장에서는 1948년과 1985년 사이에 고래 2,574마리가 처리되었다. 1960년대와 1970년대에 보리고래는 아이슬란드 고래잡이 업자들이 큰고래에 이어 가장 많이 잡던 종이었으며, 고래기름보다 고기가 더 중요시 되자 이러한 추세는 더욱 강화되었다.[42]
1920년대에는 이베리아 반도에서 스페인 출신 고래잡이 업자들에 인해 보리고래 몇 마리가 잡히기도 하였으며,[45] 1960년대와 1970년대에는 캐나다의 고래잡이 업자들이 노바스코샤에서 포획하기도 하였다.[38] 서부 그린란드에서는 1920년대와 1950년대 사이에 노르웨이와 덴마크 고래잡이 업자들이 이 지역에서 보리고래를 포획하기도 하였다.[40]
북태평양 [편집]
1910년과 1975년 사이에 북태평양에서 포획된 보리고래는 72,215마리에 달하며,[8] 대부분은 1947년이후에 잡힌 것들이다.[46] 한국과 일본에 있던 해체장에서는 1911년과 1955년 사이에 연간 보리고래 300-600마리가 처리되었다. 1959년에 일본은 최대 포획량인 1,340마리를 달성했다. 1960년대 초를 시작으로 북태평양 대양에 있는 개체를 남획하기 시작했으며, 1963년과 1974년사이의 연간 평균 포획량은 3,643마리에 달했다 (총 포획량은 43,719마리였다).[47] 남획이 시작된 후 1971년에 이르러 일본 연안에서는 보리고래가 희귀해져 서북태평양에서 상업적 고래잡이는 1975년에 중지되었다.[48][24]
북아메리카 해안에서는 1950년대부터 1960년대까지 브리티시 컬럼비아 해안에서 잡혔으며, 말기에 연간 포획량이 14마리로 감소하자 고래잡이가 중지되었다.[3] 1962년과 1967년사이에 브리티시 컬럼비아에서 잡힌 보리고래는 2,000마리 이상이다.[49] 1957년과 1971년 사이에 캘리포니아의 처리장은 386마리를 처리했다.[15] 동북태평양에서 보리고래에 대한 상업적 포획은 1971년에 중지되었다.
남반구 [편집]
남반구에서 1910년과 1979년 사이에 포획된 보리고래는 152,233마리에 달한다.[8] 남극해에 이루어진 고래잡이업자들은 처음에는 흑고래를 노렸다. 1913년에 이르러 흑고래가 잘 잡히지 않게 되었으며, 큰고래와 대왕고래의 포획량이 증가하기 시작하였다. 이들 또한 잘 잡히지 않게 되어 1950년대와 1960년대에 이르러 보리고래의 포획량이 급상승하였다.[24] 1964년에 잡힌 보리고래는 20,000마리였지만, 1976년에 잡힌 수는 2,000마리 이하로 급감하였으며 이에 따라 이들에 대한 상업적 고래잡이는 1977년에 종료되었다.[3]
국제적 보호 조치 [편집]


국제포경위원회 가입국 (푸른색)
보리고래에 대한 국제적 보호 조치는 북태평양 개체군에 대한 연간 포획량 제한이 국제포경위원회에 의해 정해진 1970년까지 마련되지 못했다. 연간 포획량이 정해지기 전까지는 고래잡이 업자들이 보리고래를 찾는 즉시 잡아도 하자가 없었다.[50] 북태평양에서 보리고래는 1976년 이래로 완전히 보호되기 시작하였으며, 북대서양에서는 1977년 이래로 포획 분량이 정해졌다. 남반구 개체군에 대한 포획은 1979년 이래로 금지되었다. 다른 고래들이 멸종위기를 맞고 있다는 총의 하에 국제포경위원회는 1986년에 국제적으로 상업적 고래잡이를 중지하기로 결의하였다.[5]
1970년대 말에는 동부 북대서양에서 불법으로 보리고래가 잡히기도 하였다.[51] 북태평양에서 보리고래가 불법적으로 잡혔다는 흔적은 거의 없지만, 소련이 포획량을 과소 보고한 적은 있으며,[52] 이에 따라 실제 포획량은 이보다 많을 수도 있다.
국제자연보호연맹의 레드리스트에 보리고래는 멸종위기종으로 올라 있다.[2] 북반구 개체군은 국제 야생동식물 멸종위기종 거래에 관한 조약의 부속서 II에 올라와 있다. 남반구 개체군은 이보다 더 심해 부속서 I에 올라와 있으며, 이는 이들에 대한 무역이 중지되지 않으면 남반구에서 보리고래는 멸종의 도가니에 빠진다는 것을 의미한다.[6]
현재 포획 상황 [편집]
국제포경위원회가 상업적 고래잡이 중지를 선언한 이후 아이슬란드와 일본의 고래잡이 업자에 의해 소수의 보리고래가 "연구목적"의 고래잡이라는 명분으로 잡혔다. 아이슬란드는 1986년과 1989년사이에 연구목적의 고래잡이를 실시해 연간 40마리를 잡았다.[53]
일본의 고래잡이 업자들은 같은 목적으로 연간 보리고래 50마리를 잡는다. 연구는 도쿄에 있는 민간단체인 고래연구기관에 의해 이루어진다. 연구의 목적은 보리고래가 무엇을 먹는가를 알아내 고래와 어부들이 얼마나 경쟁을 하는 가를 알아보는 데에 있다. 기관의 관계자인 오스미 세이지는 "고래는 인간이 잡는 수산자원의 3에서 5배를 소비하며, 고래 연구는 해양자원 관리에 필요한 중요한 자료를 제공한다" 라고 하였다.[54] 그는 이후에 "서북태평양에서 보리고래는 2번째로 풍부한 종이며, 28,000마리 이상이 있다. 그들은 확실히 멸종 위기에 놓여 있지 않다"라고 덧붙여 말했다.[55]
세계 자연보호 기금같은 환경단체는 고래는 인간이 먹지 않는 오징어나 플랑크톤을 먹는다며 이러한 연구를 비판했다. 그들은 또한 연구를 "고래잡이 어선을 돌아가게 하는 원동력, 그이상 그 이하도 아니며, 고래가 인간의 죄를 대신 뒤집어 쓰고 있다" 라고 하였다.[9] 연구의 과학적 의의는 아주 낮다고 비판받아 왔으며, 2001년 국제포경위원회 총의에서 과학자 32명은 일본의 연구목적 고래잡이는 과학적 측면이 부족하고 학술심사의 최소 기준에도 못미치는 면을 지적하였다.[56]
개체수 측정 [편집]

현재 전 세계에 있는 보리고래의 숫자는 54,000마리로, 상업적 고래잡이 개시 이전의 20% 수준이다.[7] 북대서양에서 1991년에 이루어진 측정에 의하면 이 지역의 개체수는 4,000마리 였다.[57] 이 측정법은 고래를 찾는데 필요한 시간과 노력을 이용한 것이다. 이는 과학계에서 비판을 받고 있는 방법이며, 정확한 측정방법으로 여겨지지 않는다.[58] 노르웨이 북부에서 1960년대와 1970년대에는 드물었다고 하지만, 19세기 말에서 제2차 세계대전까지 많이 포획되었다.[59] 이러한 급감은 남획,[59] 보리고래의 주식인 요각류의 숫자 감소가 분포 범위에 영향을 주었다는 설[60] 등 다양하다. 덴마크 해협에서 1987년 이루어진 조사에 의하면 1,290마리가 있었으며, 1989년에는 1,590마리가 있었다.[60] 노바스코샤인근의 개체수는 1,393마리에서 2,248마리로 추산되며, 더 적게는 870마리로 추정되기도 한다.[38]

Ernest Augustus I (5 June 1771 – 18 November 1851) was King of Hanover from 20 June 1837 until his death. He was the fifth son and eighth child of George III, who reigned in both the United Kingdom and Hanover. As a fifth son, initially Ernest seemed unlikely to become a monarch, but Salic Law, which barred women from the succession, applied in Hanover and none of his older brothers had legitimate male issue.
Ernest was born in England, but was sent to Hanover in his adolescence for his education and military training. While serving with Hanoverian forces in Wallonia against Revolutionary France, he received a disfiguring facial wound. In 1799, he was created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale. Although his 1815 marriage to the twice-widowed Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz met with the disapproval of his mother, Queen Charlotte, it proved a happy relationship. By 1817, the mad King George III had only one legitimate grandchild, Princess Charlotte of Wales, and when she died in childbirth, Ernest was the senior son to be both married and not estranged from his wife. This gave him some prospect of succeeding to the British throne. However, both of his unmarried older brothers quickly married, and King George's fourth son, Edward, Duke of Kent, fathered the eventual British heir, Princess Victoria of Kent.
Ernest was active in the House of Lords, where he maintained an extremely conservative record. There were persistent allegations (reportedly spread by his political foes) that he had murdered his valet and had fathered a son by his sister, Princess Sophia of the United Kingdom. Before Victoria succeeded to the British Throne, it was rumoured that Ernest intended to murder her and take the Throne himself. When King William IV died on 20 June 1837, Ernest ascended the Hanoverian Throne. Hanover's first ruler to reside in the kingdom since George I, he had a generally successful fourteen-year reign, but excited controversy when he dismissed the Göttingen Seven (including the two Brothers Grimm) from their professorial positions for agitating against his policies.

Ernest Augustus, the fifth son of George III and Queen Charlotte, was born at Buckingham House, now part of Buckingham Palace on 5 June 1771. After leaving the nursery, he lived with his two younger brothers, Prince Adolphus (later Duke of Cambridge) and Prince Augustus (later Duke of Sussex), and a tutor in a house on Kew Green, near his parents' residence at Kew Palace.[1] At the age of fifteen, he and his two younger brothers were sent to the University of Göttingen, located in his father's domain of Hanover.[1] Though the King never left the United Kingdom in his life, he sent his younger sons to Germany in their adolescence. According to historian John Van der Kiste, this was done to limit the influence Ernest's eldest brother George, Prince of Wales, who was leading an extravagant lifestyle, would have over his younger brothers.[2] Prince Ernest proved an apt student, and after being tutored privately for a year, while learning German, attended lectures at the University. Though King George ordered that the princes' household be run along military lines, and that they follow university rules, the town merchants proved willing to extend credit to the princes, and all three fell into debt.[3]
In 1790, Ernest asked his father for permission to train with Prussian forces. Instead, in January 1791, he and Prince Adolphus were sent to Hanover to receive military training under the supervision of Field Marshal Wilhelm von Freytag. Before leaving Göttingen, Ernest penned a formal letter of thanks to the university, and wrote to his father, "I should be one of the most ungrateful of men if ever I was forgetful of all I owe to Göttingen & its professors."[4]
Ernest learned cavalry drill and tactics under Captain von Linsinger of the Queen's Light Dragoons, and proved to be an excellent horseman as well as a good shot.[5] After only two months of training, von Freytag was so impressed by the Prince's progress that he gave him a place in the cavalry as captain. Ernest was supposed to receive infantry training, but the King, also impressed by his son's prowess, allowed him to remain with the cavalry.[6]
In March 1792, the King commissioned Prince Ernest Augustus as a colonel in the 9th Hanoverian Light Dragoons.[7] The Prince served in the Low Countries in the War of the First Coalition, under his elder brother Frederick, Duke of York, then commander of the combined British, Hanoverian and Austrian forces. Seeing action near the Walloon town of Tournai in August 1793, he sustained a sabre wound to the head,[8] which resulted in a disfiguring scar.[9] During the Battle of Tourcoing in northern France on 18 May 1794 his left arm was injured by a cannonball which passed close by him. In the days after the battle, the sight in his left eye faded. In June, he was sent to Britain to convalesce, his first stay there since 1786.[8]
Ernest resumed his duties in early November, by now promoted to major-general.[10] He hoped his new rank would bring him a corps or brigade command, but none was forthcoming as Allied armies retreated slowly through the Netherlands towards Germany.[11] By February 1795, they had reached Hanover. Ernest remained in Hanover over the next year, at several unimportant postings. He had requested a return home to seek treatment for his eye, but it was not until early 1796 that the King agreed and allowed Ernest to return to Britain.[12] In Britain, Prince Ernest consulted the noted eye doctor, Wathen Waller, but Waller apparently found the condition inoperable, as no operation took place.[13] Once in Britain, Ernest repeatedly sought to be allowed to join British forces on the Continent, even threatening to join the Yeomanry as a private, but both the King and the Duke of York refused. Ernest did not want to rejoin Hanoverian forces, as the Hanoverians were not then involved in the fighting. In addition, von Freytag was seriously ill, and Ernest was unwilling to serve under his likely successor, General von Wallmoden.[14]

On 23 April 1799, George III created Prince Ernest Augustus Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh.[15] Though he was made a lieutenant-general, both of British and Hanoverian forces,[16] he remained in England, and, with a seat in the House of Lords, entered politics. Ernest had extreme Tory views, and soon became a leader of the right of the party.[17] King George had feared that Ernest, like some of his older brothers, would display Whig tendencies. Reassured on that point, in 1801, the King had Ernest conduct the negotiations which led to the formation of the Addington Government.[18] In February 1802, King George granted his son the colonelcy of the 27th Light Dragoons, a post which offered the option of transfer to the colonelcy of the 15th Light Dragoons when a vacancy developed. A vacancy promptly occurred and the Duke became the colonel of the 15th Light Dragoons in March 1802. Although the post could have been a sinecure, Ernest involved himself in the affairs of the regiment and led it on manoeuvres.[19]
In early 1803, the Duke of York appointed Ernest as commander of the Severn District, in charge of the forces in and around the Severn Estuary. When war with France broke out again after the Peace of Amiens, the elder Duke appointed Ernest to the more important Southwest District, comprising Hampshire, Dorset and Wiltshire. Though Ernest would have preferred command of the King's German Legion, composed mostly of expatriates from French-occupied Hanover, he accepted the post. The Duke of Cumberland increased the defences on the South Coast, especially around the town of Weymouth, where his father often spent time in the summer.[20]

The 1800 Acts of Union had given Ireland representation in Parliament, but existing law prevented the Irish Catholics from serving there because of their religion. "Catholic emancipation" was a major political issue of the first years of the 19th century. The Duke of Cumberland was a strong opponent of giving political rights to Catholics, believing that emancipation would be a violation of the King's Coronation Oath to uphold Anglicanism, and spoke out in the House of Lords against emancipation.[21] Protestant Irish organisations supported the Duke; he was elected Chancellor of the University of Dublin in 1805[22] and Grand Master of the Orange Lodges two years later.[23]
The Duke repeatedly sought a post with Allied forces fighting against France, but was sent to the Continent only as an observer. In 1807, he advocated sending British troops to join with the Prussians and Swedes and attack the French at Stralsund (today, in northeastern Germany). The Greville government refused to send forces. Shortly afterwards, the government fell, and the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Portland, agreed to send Ernest with 20,000 troops. However, they were sent too late: the French defeated Prussia and Sweden at the Battle of Stralsund before Ernest and his forces could reach the town.[24]
[edit]Sellis incident and Weymouth controversy
In the early hours of 31 May 1810, Ernest, by his written account, was struck in the head several times while asleep in bed, awakening him. He ran for the door, where he was wounded in the leg by a sabre. He called for help, and one of his valets, Cornelius Neale, responded and aided him. Neale raised the alarm, and the household soon realised that Ernest's other valet, Joseph Sellis, was not among them, and that the door to Sellis's room was locked. The lock was forced, and Sellis was discovered with his throat freshly cut, a wound apparently self-inflicted.[25] Ernest received several serious wounds during the apparent attack, and required over a month to recover from his injuries.[26] The social reformer and anti-monarchist Francis Place managed to get on the inquest jury and became its foreman. Place went to the office of a barrister friend to study inquest law, and aggressively questioned witnesses. Place also insisted the inquest be opened to the public and press, and so cowed the coroner that he basically ran the inquest himself. Nevertheless, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of suicide against Sellis.[27]

The brown section at lower right covers an image of the ghost of Sellis (visible if enlarged), who hints at the Duke's involvement in his death (Cruikshank self-censored most copies for fear of a libel suit).[28]
Much of the public blamed Ernest for Sellis's death.[29] The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious explanations for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame.[30] Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together.[29] Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had played a part in the death.[31] Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke to the fact that he did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.[32][33]
In early 1813, Ernest was involved in political scandal during an election contest in Weymouth following the general election the previous year. The Duke was shown to be one of three trustees who were able to dictate who would represent Weymouth in Parliament. It being considered improper for a peer to interfere in a Commons election, there was considerable controversy, and the Government sent Ernest to Europe as an observer to accompany Hanoverian troops, which were again engaged in war against France.[34] Though he saw no action, Ernest was present at the Battle of Leipzig, a major victory for the Allies.[35]
[edit]Marriage
Ernest met and fell in love in mid-1813 with his first cousin, Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of Frederick William, Prince of Solms-Braunfels and widow of Prince Louis of Prussia. The two agreed to wed if Frederica became free to marry. Her marriage to Frederick William had not been a success; her husband, seeing the marriage was beyond hope, agreed to a divorce, but his sudden death in 1814 removed the necessity. Some considered the death too convenient, and suspected the princess of poisoning her husband.[36] Queen Charlotte opposed the marriage: before the princess had married Frederick William, she had jilted Ernest's brother, the Duke of Cambridge, after the engagement was announced.[37]
Following the marriage in Germany on 29 May 1815, Queen Charlotte refused to receive her new daughter-in-law,[38] nor would the Queen attend the resolemnisation of the Cumberlands' marriage at Kew, which Ernest's four older brothers attended. The Prince of Wales (now Prince Regent) found the Cumberlands' presence in Britain embarrassing, and offered him money and the Governorship of Hanover if they would leave for the Continent. Ernest refused, and the Cumberlands divided their time between Kew and St. James's Palace for the next three years. The Queen remained obstinate in her refusal to receive Frederica.[39] Despite these family troubles, the Cumberlands had a happy marriage.[40] The Government of Lord Liverpool asked Parliament to increase the Duke's allowance by ₤6,000 per year in 1815, so he could meet increased expenses due to his marriage. The Duke's involvement in the Weymouth election became an issue, and the bill failed by one vote.[41] Liverpool tried again in 1817; this time the bill failed by seven votes.[42]
At the time of the Duke's marriage in 1815, it seemed to have little dynastic significance to Britain. Princess Charlotte of Wales, only child of the Prince Regent, was the King's only legitimate grandchild. The young Princess was expected to have children who would secure the British succession, especially after she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in 1816.[43] Both the Prince Regent and the Duke of York were married but estranged from their wives, while the next two brothers, the Dukes of Clarence and Kent, were unmarried.[44] On 6 November 1817, Princess Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. King George was left with twelve surviving children, and no surviving legitimate grandchildren.[45] Most of the unmarried royal dukes hurriedly sought out suitable brides and hastened to the altar, hoping to father the heir to the throne.[44]
Seeing little prospect of the Queen giving in and receiving her daughter-in-law, the Cumberlands moved to Germany in 1818. They had difficulty living within their means in Britain, and the cost of living was much lower in Germany.[46] Queen Charlotte died on 17 November 1818, but the Cumberlands remained in Germany, living principally in Berlin, where the Duchess had relatives.[47] In 1817, the Duchess had a stillborn daughter; in 1819 she gave birth to a boy, Prince George of Cumberland. The Duke occasionally visited England, where he stayed with his eldest brother, who in 1820 succeeded to the British and Hanoverian Thrones as George IV.[48] George III's fourth son, Edward, Duke of Kent, died six days before his father, but left a daughter, Princess Victoria of Kent.[49] With the death of George III, Ernest became fourth in line to the British Throne, following the Duke of York (who would die without legitimate issue in 1827), the Duke of Clarence, and Princess Victoria.[50]
[edit]Politics and unpopularity

In 1826, Parliament finally voted to increase Ernest's allowance. The Liverpool Government had argued that the Duke needed an increased allowance to pay for Prince George's education; even so, it was opposed by many Whigs.[51] The bill, which passed the House of Commons 120–97, required Prince George to live in England if the Duke was to receive the money.[52]
In 1828, Ernest was staying with the King at Windsor Castle when severe disturbances broke out in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland, and returned to Berlin in August, believing that the Government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly with the Irish.[53] In January 1829, the Wellington Government announced that it would introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned to London, and was one of the leaders against the Catholic Relief Act 1829, influencing King George against the bill.[54] Within days of his arrival, the King instructed the officers of his Household to vote against the Bill. Hearing of this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted Wellington's resignation, and Ernest attempted to put together a government united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a government would have considerable support in the House of Lords, it would have little support in the Commons, and Ernest abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The bill passed the Lords and became law.[55]
The Wellington Government hoped that Ernest would return to Germany, but he moved his wife and son to Britain in 1829. The Times reported that they would live at Windsor in the "Devil's Tower"; instead, the Duke reopened his house at Kew.[56] They settled there as rumours flew that Thomas Garth, thought to be the illegitimate son of Ernest's sister Princess Sophia, had been fathered by Ernest. It was also said that Ernest had blackmailed the King by threatening to expose this secret, though Van der Kiste points out that Ernest would have been ill-advised to blackmail with a secret which, if exposed, would destroy him.[57] These rumours were spread as Ernest journeyed to London to fight against Catholic emancipation. Whig politician and diarist Thomas Creevey wrote about the Garth rumour in mid-February, and there is some indication the rumours began with Princess Lieven, wife of the Russian ambassador.[58]
Newspapers also reported, in July 1829, that the Duke had been thrown out of Lord Lyndhurst's house for assaulting his wife Sarah, Lady Lyndhurst.[57] In early 1830, a number of newspapers printed articles hinting that Ernest was having an affair with Lady Graves, a mother of fifteen now past fifty.[59] In February 1830, Lord Graves wrote a note to his wife expressing his confidence in her innocence, then cut his own throat. Two days after Lord Graves's death (and the day after the inquest), The Times printed an article connecting Lord Graves's death with Sellis's. After being shown the suicide note, The Times withdrew its implication there might be a connection between the two deaths. Nonetheless, many believed the Duke responsible for the suicide—or guilty of a second murder.[60] The Duke later stated that he had been "accused of every crime in the decalogue".[61] Ernest's biographer, Anthony Bird, states that while there is no proof, he has no doubt that the rumours against the Duke were spread by the Whigs for political ends.[62] Another biographer, Geoffrey Willis, pointed out that no scandal had attached itself to the Duke during the period of over a decade when he resided in Germany; it was only when he announced his intent to return to Britain that "a campaign of unparalleled viciousness" began against him.[63] According to Bird, Ernest was the most unpopular man in England.[64]

The Duke's influence at Court was ended by the death of George IV in June 1830 and the succession of the Duke of Clarence as William IV. Wellington wrote that "The effect of the King's death will ... be to put an end to the Duke of Cumberland's political character and power in this country entirely".[65] King William lacked legitimate children (two girls having died in infancy)[50] and Ernest was now heir in Hanover, since the British heir, Victoria, as a female could not inherit there. William realized that so long as the Duke maintained a power base at Windsor, he could wield unwanted influence. The Duke was Gold Stick as head of the Household Cavalry; William made the Duke's post responsible to the Commander in Chief rather than to the King, and an insulted Ernest, outraged at the thought of having to report to an officer less senior than himself, resigned. King William again emerged triumphant when the new Queen, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, wished to quarter her horses in the stables customarily used by the consort, but which were then occupied by Ernest's horses. Ernest initially refused the King's order to remove the horses, but gave in when told that William's grooms would remove them if Ernest did not move them voluntarily.[65] However, Ernest and William remained friendly throughout the latter's seven-year reign.[66] Ernest's house at Kew was too small for his family; the King gave the Duke and Duchess lifetime residence in a nearby, larger house by the entrance to Kew Gardens.[67] Ernest opposed the Reform Act 1832, and was one of the "diehard" peers who voted against the bill on its final reading when most Tories abstained under threat of seeing the House of Lords flooded with Whig peers.[68]
Ernest was the subject of more allegations in 1832, when two young women accused him of trying to ride them down as they walked near Hammersmith. The Duke had not left his grounds at Kew on the day in question, and was able to ascertain that the rider was one of his equerries, who professed not to have seen the women. Nevertheless, newspapers continued to print references to the incident, suggesting that Ernest had done what the women stated, and was cravenly trying to push blame on another. The same year, the Duke sued for libel after a book appeared accusing him of having his valet Neale kill Sellis, and the jury found against the author.[69] Also in 1832, the Cumberlands suffered tragedy, as young Prince George went blind. The Prince had been blind in one eye from infancy; an accident at age thirteen took the sight of the other. Ernest had hoped his son might marry Princess Victoria and keep the British and Hanoverian Thrones united, but the handicap made it unlikely George could win Princess Victoria's hand, and raised questions about whether he should succeed in Hanover.[70]
The Duke spent William's reign in the House of Lords, where he was assiduous in his attendance. Wrote newspaper editor James Grant, "He is literally—the door-keeper of course excepted—the first man in the House, and the last out of it. And this not merely generally, but every night."[71] Grant, in his observations of the leading members of the House of Lords, indicated that the Duke was not noted for his oratory (he delivered no speech longer than five minutes) and had a voice that was difficult to understand, though, "his manner is most mild and conciliatory."[71] Grant denigrated the Duke's intellect and influence, but stated that the Duke had indirect influence over several members, and that, "he is by no means so bad a tactician as his opponents suppose."[72]
Controversy arose in 1836 over the Orange Lodges. The lodges (which took anti-Catholic views) were said to be ready to rise and try to put the Duke of Cumberland on the Throne on the death of King William. According to Joseph Hume, speaking in the House of Commons, Princess Victoria was to be passed over on the grounds of her age, sex, and incapacity.[73] The Commons passed a resolution calling for the dissolution of the lodges. When the matter reached the Lords, the Duke defended himself, saying of Princess Victoria, "I would shed the last drop of my blood for my niece."[74] The Duke indicated that the Orange Lodge members were loyal and were willing to dissolve the lodges in Great Britain. According to Bird, this incident was the source of the widespread rumours that the Duke intended to murder Princess Victoria and take the British Throne for himself.[75]

[edit]Constitutional controversy
On 20 June 1837, King William died, and Princess Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. Ernest became the King of Hanover. On 28 June 1837, King Ernest entered his new domain, passing under a triumphal arch.[76] For the first time in over a century, Hanover would have a ruler living there.[77] Many Hanoverians were of a liberal perspective, and would have preferred the popular viceroy, the Duke of Cambridge, to become king, but both of Ernest's younger brothers refused to lend themselves to any movement by which they would become king rather than their elder brother. According to Roger Fulford in his study of George III's younger sons, Royal Dukes, "In 1837, King Ernest was the only male descendant of George III who was willing and able to continue the connection with Hanover."[78]

Hanover had received its first constitution, granted by the Prince Regent, in 1819; this did little more than denote Hanover's change from an electorate to a kingdom, granted by the Congress of Vienna. The Duke of Cambridge, as King William's viceroy in Hanover, recommended a thorough reorganisation of the Hanoverian government. William IV had given his consent to a new constitution in 1833; the Duke of Cumberland's consent was neither asked nor received, and he had formally protested against the constitution's adoption without his consent.[79] One provision of the constitution transferred the Hanoverian Domains (the equivalent of the British Crown Estate) from the sovereign to the state, eroding the monarch's power.[76]
Immediately upon his arrival in Hanover, the King dissolved the parliament which had been convened under the disputed constitution. On 5 July, he proclaimed the suspension of the constitution, on the ground that his consent had not been asked, and that it did not meet the kingdom's needs.[79] On 1 November 1837, the King issued a patent, declaring the constitution void, but upholding all laws passed under it.[80] The 1819 constitution was restored. The Crown Prince, Prince George, endorsed the action.[81]
In carrying the King's patent into effect, the Cabinet required all officeholders (including professors at Göttingen University) to renew their oaths of allegiance to the King. Seven professors (including the two Brothers Grimm) refused to take the oaths, and agitated for others to protest against the King's decree. Since they did not take the oaths, the seven lost their positions, and the King expelled the three most responsible (including Jacob Grimm) from Hanover.[80] Only one of the seven, orientalist Heinrich Ewald was a citizen of Hanover and he was not expelled.[82] In the final years of the King's reign, the three were invited to return.[83]
The King wrote of the incident to his brother-in-law, Frederick William III of Prussia, "If each of these seven gentlemen had addressed a letter to me expressing his opinion, I would have had no cause to take exception to their conduct. But to call a meeting and publish their opinions even before the Government had received their protest—that is what they have done and that I cannot allow."[84] Ernest received a deputation of Göttingen citizens, who, fearing student unrest, applauded the dismissals. However, he was widely criticised in Europe, especially in Britain.[85] In the House of Commons, MP Colonel Thomas Perronet Thompson proposed to Parliament that if the as-yet-childless Queen Victoria died, making Ernest the British King, Parliament should declare that King Ernest had forfeited all rights to the British Throne by his actions.[86]
A more significant protest against the revocation of the 1833 constitution was the refusal of a number of towns to appoint parliamentary deputies. However, by 1840, a sufficient number of deputies had been appointed for the King to summon Parliament, which met for two weeks in August, approving a modified version of the 1819 constitution, passing a budget, and sending a vote of thanks to the King. The Parliament met again the following year, passed a three-year budget, and adjourned again.[87]
[edit]National development and trade; 1848 crisis
At the time the King took the throne, the city of Hanover was a densely packed residential town, and did not rise to the grand style of many German capitals. Once the political crises of the first years of his reign had subsided, he set out to remedy this state of affairs.[88] Ernest's support led to gas lighting in the city streets of Hanover, up-to-date sanitation and the development of a new residential quarter. He had the plans altered in 1841, after Queen Frederica's death, to leave standing the Altes Palais, where the two had lived since arriving in Hanover.[40] Ernest's interest in and support of the railroads led to Hanover becoming a major rail junction, much to the nation's benefit.[40] However, when court architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves in 1837 proposed the building of an opera house in Hanover, the King initially refused, calling the proposal "this utterly absurd idea of building a court theatre in the middle of this green field".[89] The King finally gave his consent in 1844, and the opera house opened in 1852, a year after the King's death.[89]

Every week, the King travelled with his secretary to different parts of his kingdom, and anyone could lay a petition before him—although Ernest had petitions screened by the secretary so he would not have to deal with frivolous complaints.[90] Ernest opened high ministerial positions to those of any class, securing the services of several ministers who would not have been eligible without this reform.[91] Though the King had, while Duke of Cumberland, fought against Catholic emancipation, he made no objection to Catholics in government service in Hanover, and even visited their churches. Ernest explained this by stating that there were no historical reasons to restrict Catholics in Hanover, and there had been in the United Kingdom.[92] He continued to oppose admission of Jews into the British Parliament, but gave Jews in Hanover equal rights.[93]
The King supported a postal union and common currency among the German states, but opposed the Prussian-led customs union, the Zollverein, fearing that it would lead to Prussian dominance and the end of Hanover as an independent state. Instead, the King supported the Steuerverein, which Hanover and other western German states had formed in 1834. When the Steuerverein treaties came up for renewal in 1841, Brunswick pulled out of the union and joined the Zollverein, greatly weakening Hanover's position, especially since Brunswick had enclaves within Hanover. Ernest was able to postpone the enclaves' entry into the Zollverein, and when a trade war began, was able to outlast Brunswick. In 1845, Brunswick, Hanover, and Prussia signed a trade agreement. In 1850, Ernest reluctantly permitted Hanover to join the Zollverein, though the entry was on favourable terms.[94] Ernest's forebodings about Prussia were warranted; in 1866, fifteen years after his death, Hanover chose the Austrian side in the Austro-Prussian War, was defeated, and was annexed by Prussia.[95]
Hanover was little affected by the revolutions of 1848; a few small disturbances were put down by the cavalry without bloodshed.[96] When agitators arrived from Berlin at the end of May 1848, and there were demonstrations outside the King's palace, Ernest sent out the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister warned that if the demonstrators made any inappropriate demands on the King, Ernest would pack up his things and leave for Britain, taking the Crown Prince with him. This would leave the country to the mercy of expansionist Prussia, and the threat put an end to the agitation. Afterwards, the King granted a new constitution, somewhat more liberal than the 1819 document.[97]

Ernest Augustus is supposed to have asked the advice of the Duke of Wellington as to what course he should take after Victoria's accession, with Wellington supposedly saying "Go before you are pelted out."[99] However, Bird dismisses this story as unlikely, given Wellington's customary respect to royalty and the fact that Ernest had little choice in what to do—he had to repair to his kingdom as quickly as possible.[100] One decision the new King did have to make was whether, in his capacity as Duke of Cumberland, to swear allegiance to Victoria in the House of Lords. Shortly after William's death, Ernest heard from Lord Lyndhurst that Lord Cottenham, the Lord Chancellor, had stated that he would refuse to administer the Oath of Allegiance to the King, as a foreign Sovereign. The King hurriedly appeared in the House of Lords, before his departure for Hanover, and subscribed to the Oath before the Chief Clerk as a matter of routine.[101] Ernest was heir presumptive to his niece until the birth of Queen Victoria's daughter, also named Victoria, in November 1840. The Lord Privy Seal, Lord Clarendon, wrote, "What the country cares about is to have a life more, whether male or female, between the succession and the King of Hanover."[102]
Almost immediately upon going to Hanover, the King became involved in a dispute with his niece. Victoria, who had a strained relationship with her mother, the Duchess of Kent, wanted to give the Duchess accommodation near her, for the sake of appearances—but not too near her. To that end, she asked the King to give up his apartments at St. James's Palace in favour of the Duchess. The King, wishing to retain apartments in London in anticipation of frequent visits to England, and reluctant to give way in favour of a woman who had frequently fought with his brother, King William, declined, and Victoria angrily rented a house for her mother. At a time when the young Queen was trying to pay off her father's debts, she saw this as unnecessary expense.[103] Her ill-feeling towards the King increased when he refused, and advised his two surviving brothers to similarly refuse, to give precedence to her intended spouse, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ernest argued that the standing of the various royal families had been settled at the Congress of Vienna, and the King of Hanover should not have to yield to one whom he described as a "paper Royal Highness".[104] The act which naturalised Albert as a British subject left the question of his precedence unresolved.[104]
Matters came to a head when Ernest returned for what would prove to be his only visit to England as King of Hanover, in 1843. He was welcomed warmly, everywhere but at the Palace.[105] At the wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, he attempted to insist on a superior place to that of Prince Albert. The 50-years-younger prince settled things with what Albert described as a "strong push," and carefully wrote his name on the certificate under the Queen's, so close to his wife's as to leave no space for the King's signature.[106] The King apparently held no grudge, as he invited the Prince for a stroll in the park. When Albert demurred on the grounds that they might be jostled by crowds, the King replied, "When I lived here I was quite as unpopular as you are and they never bothered me."[107] Shortly after the wedding, the King injured himself in a fall, with Albert writing to his brother, "Happily he fell over some stones in Kew and damaged some ribs." This injury spared him further contact with Victoria and Albert.[108] During his visit, the King found time to take his place as Duke of Cumberland in the House of Lords. Victoria recorded in her journal that the King had stated when asked if he would speak in the Lords, "No, I shall not, unless the Devil prompts me!"[109] The Queen also recorded that though King Ernest greatly enjoyed listening to the debates, he did not himself speak.[109]
The monarchs engaged in one more battle—over jewels left by Queen Charlotte. Victoria, who possessed them, took the position that they belonged to the British Crown. King Ernest maintained that they were to go to the heir male, that is, himself. The matter was arbitrated, and just as the arbitrators were about to announce a decision in Hanover's favour, one of the arbitrators died, voiding the decision. Despite the King's request for a new panel, Victoria refused to permit one during the King's lifetime, and took every opportunity to wear the jewels, causing the King to write to his friend, Lord Strangford, "The little Queen looked very fine, I hear, loaded down with my diamonds." The King's son and heir, King George V, pressed the matter, and in 1858, after another decision in Hanover's favour, the jewels were turned over to the Hanoverian ambassador.[110]
The King made a point of welcoming British visitors, and when one Englishwoman told him that she had been lost in the city, the King denied that this was possible, as "the whole country is no larger than a fourpenny bit."[111]

In 1851, the King undertook a number of journeys around Germany. He accepted an invitation from the Prussian Queen to visit Charlottenburg Palace, near Berlin.[112] He visited Mecklenburg for the christening of the Grand Duke's son, and Luneburg to inspect his old regiment. In June Ernest celebrated his 80th birthday by playing host to the King of Prussia. Late that summer, he visited Göttingen, where he opened a new hospital and was given a torchlight procession.[113]
The King continued his interest in British affairs, and wrote to Lord Strangford about the Great Exhibition of 1851:
The folly and absurdity of the Queen in allowing this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers themselves do not insist on her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may occur on the occasion. The idea ... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. But it seems everything is conspiring to lower us in the eyes of Europe.[114]
The King died on 18 November 1851 after an illness of about a month. He was mourned greatly in Hanover; less so in England where The Times omitted the customary black border to its front page and claimed "the good that can be said of the Royal dead is little or none."[115] Both he and Queen Frederica rest in a mausoleum in the Herrenhausen Gardens.[116]
A large equestrian statue of King Ernest Augustus may be found in a square named after him in front of the railway station in Hanover, inscribed with his name and the words (in German) "To the father of the nation from his loyal people." It is a popular meeting place; in the local phrase, people arrange to meet unterm Schwanz or "under the tail" (that is, of the horse which the King rides).[117]
Although The Times denigrated Ernest's career as Duke of Cumberland, it did speak well of his time as King of Hanover, and of his success in keeping Hanover stable in 1848:
Above all, he possessed a resolute decision of character, which, however unfortunately it may have operated under different conditions, appeared to extraordinary advantage at the crisis of continental thrones. Bewildered by the revolutionary din, and oscillating ignominiously between fear and rage, resistance and concession, the clique of crowned heads suffered greatly by contrast with a Sovereign who at least knew his own mind, and was prepared to abide by his opinions. In the European convulsions, therefore, King Ernest maintained the stability of his throne and the tranquillity of his people without damage from revolution or reaction. As Kings, indeed, are computed on the continent, he was an able and even a popular Monarch, and his memory may find, perhaps, in his ancestral dominions a sympathy which it would be vain to bespeak for it in the scenes of his manhood or the land of his birth.[118]

William McGregor (13 April 1846 – 20 December 1911)[1][2] was an association football administrator in the Victorian era, who is regarded as the founder of the Football League, the first organised football league in the world.
After moving from Perthshire to Birmingham to set up business as a draper, McGregor became involved with local football club Aston Villa, which he helped to establish as one of the leading teams in England. He served the club for over twenty years in various capacities, including president, director and chairman. In 1888, frustrated by the regular cancellation of Villa's matches, McGregor organised a meeting of representatives of England's leading clubs, which led to the formation of the Football League, giving member clubs a guaranteed fixture list each season. This was instrumental in the transition of football from an amateur pastime to a professional business.
McGregor served as both chairman and president of the Football League and was also chairman of the Football Association (the FA). He was recognised by the FA for his service to the game shortly before his death in 1911, and was posthumously honoured by the local football authorities and Aston Villa.

[edit]Personal life

Born in Braco in Perthshire, Scotland, McGregor first became interested in football after watching a match between locals and visiting artisans at Ardoch.[3][4] He served an apprenticeship as a draper in Perth, and in 1870, following the example of his brother Peter, moved to Birmingham,[4][5] and opened his own drapery business in Aston, an area just outside the city.[6] Upon his arrival in the Midlands he became involved with a local football club, Calthorpe, which had been formed by a fellow Scot, Campbell Orr.[4][7] McGregor was enthusiastic enough about the game to arrange for his shop to close early on Saturdays to allow him to watch matches, and he later sold football kits at the shop, which became a popular meeting place for football enthusiasts.[7]
McGregor was married to Jessie, and the couple had a daughter and a son, also named Jessie and William.[7][8] A teetotaller, McGregor was a supporter of the Temperance movement,[9] and was active in the local branch of the Liberal Party until his membership lapsed in 1882 due to the increasing amount of time he devoted to football.[10] He was involved in the early attempts to establish a baseball league in the UK, and serving as the honorary treasurer of the Baseball Association of Great Britain and Ireland.[11] Despite his commitment to sport, he retained his drapery business throughout his life.[12]

In 1877, McGregor was invited to become a committee member of Aston Villa, a club formed three years earlier. He also umpired matches for the club.[A][7][13] At the time the club played at Aston Park, close to the premises of McGregor's business.[14] He became interested in joining Villa due to the strong Scottish contingent in the club's ranks,[4] the team's exciting style of play, and the club's connection to a Wesleyan Chapel.[15] He quickly assumed the post of club administrator,[2] helping the impecunious club to survive its financial troubles. After some of Aston Villa's possessions were seized by bailiffs, McGregor allowed the club to use his shop as a store to prevent further seizures.[15] Under McGregor's leadership, Aston Villa won their first trophy, the Birmingham Senior Cup, in 1880,[16] shortly after which McGregor became the club's president.[2]
The following year McGregor became a member of the club's board of directors.[2] Villa's standing within the game continued to grow, and in 1887 the club became the first from the Midlands to win the FA Cup, defeating local rivals West Bromwich Albion in the final.[17] In 1895, McGregor became vice-chairman, and went on to become the club's chairman in 1897.[2] During his time at the club he was noted for his organisational skills and ambition,[18] and was responsible for adopting the lion rampant depicted on the Royal Standard of Scotland, as the club's crest.[19]
[edit]Founder of the Football League

As the 1880s progressed, the balance of power within English football began to change. The first national competition, the FA Cup, had previously been dominated by amateur clubs from privileged backgrounds, such as Wanderers and Old Etonians. However the 1883 FA Cup Final saw the first victory by a working-class team, Blackburn Olympic.[20] At this time professionalism was not permitted. Clubs from urban areas in the north were strong advocates of the practice, but the southern amateur teams and the FA authorities were firmly opposed.[20] Though not initially an advocate of professionalism, McGregor came to favour its introduction.[10] By 1885 the issue threatened to split the FA when a group of clubs, predominantly from Lancashire, announced their intention to leave and form a rival British Football Association if professionalism was not accepted.[20] An emergency FA conference was called in response. Representing Aston Villa, McGregor spoke in favour of professionalism, the only delegate from the Midlands to do so, and was one of the few delegates to admit that his club had been paying players.[10] Though not as outspoken as stronger proponents, such as Preston North End's William Sudell, McGregor was well respected.[10] The conference ended with the FA accepting professionalism, although each club was permitted only to pay players who had been born or lived for at least two years within six miles of its home stadium.[20]
Professionalism brought fresh complications for club administrators. Many friendlies were cancelled due to opponents' FA Cup or county cup matches taking precedence or clubs simply failing to honour a fixture in favour of a more lucrative match elsewhere. This made it hard for the clubs to pay players' wages on a regular basis.[21][22] McGregor took action after seeing Villa matches cancelled, to the increasing frustration of the club's fans, on five consecutive Saturdays.[22] On 2 March 1888,[23] he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion,[24] suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season.[25] Corinthian F.C. founder N. Lane Jackson, writing in 1899, stated that McGregor took his inspiration from the existing league set-up used in American baseball,[11] although McGregor himself cited the County Cricket Championship as his inspiration.[26] McGregor's letter to the clubs read:[25]
Every year it is becoming more and more difficult for football clubs of any standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly matches. The consequence is that at the last moment, through cup-tie interference, clubs are compelled to take on teams who will not attract the public.
I beg to tender the following suggestion as a means of getting over the difficulty: that ten or twelve of the most prominent clubs in England combine to arrange home-and-away fixtures each season, the said fixtures to be arranged at a friendly conference about the same time as the International Conference.
This combination might be known as the Association Football Union, and could be managed by representative from each club. Of course, this is in no way to interfere with the National Association; even the suggested matches might be played under cup-tie rules. However, this is a detail.
My object in writing to you at present is merely to draw your attention to the subject, and to suggest a friendly conference to discuss the matter more fully. I would take it as a favour if you would kindly think the matter over, and make whatever suggestions you deem necessary. I am only writing to the following – Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End, West Bromwich Albion, and Aston Villa, and would like to hear what other clubs you would suggest.
I am, yours very truly, William McGregor (Aston Villa F.C.)
P.S. How would Friday, 23rd March, 1888, suit for the friendly conference at Anderton's Hotel, London?
McGregor chose 23 March as the date of his proposed meeting because it was the day before the FA Cup final and representatives of the country's top clubs would be in London.[22] Representatives from ten clubs attended, including the FA Cup finalists West Bromwich Albion and Preston North End,[27] but it quickly became clear that clubs from the South of England were not interested in McGregor's proposal and none attended. A second meeting was held in Manchester on 17 April, and details concerning the new competition were finalised.[21] McGregor's suggested name for the competition, "The Association Football Union" was rejected as too similar to that of the Rugby Football Union and "The Football League" was chosen, despite McGregor's opposition on the grounds that he felt it might invoke associations with the unpopular Irish Land League.[28] The term English League was avoided, to leave the possibility of future applications from Scottish clubs.[29] McGregor also proposed a rule that only one club from each town should be included. The other founders agreed to this rule, which caused controversy, as it meant Birmingham team Mitchell St. George's were denied membership in favour of McGregor's Aston Villa.[27] Twelve clubs kicked off the first season of League football in September 1888.[30]


John Bentley, McGregor's successor as Football League president, criticised McGregor for his failure to attend many meetings during his later spell as League president.
McGregor served as the first chairman of the League's Management Committee. One of the committee's main jobs was handling issues of discipline, but committee members were not barred from involvement in decisions involving their own clubs. In fact, the first disciplinary meeting saw fines issued to three of the four clubs with representatives on the committee.[31] McGregor was re-elected unopposed in 1891. Earlier he had spoken of his pleasure that "of the 132 matches in which the League clubs have taken part and in which about 300 players have taken the field, not a single fatal accident has to be recorded".[32] A year later he oversaw the expansion of the Football League into two divisions when the rival Football Alliance was merged into the competition, but he relinquished his post later that year due to ill health, which caused him to miss meetings.[33]
After stepping down as chairman, he was unanimously elected to an honorary position of president, a role he kept until 1894, and was named the first-ever life member of the League in 1895.[34] The role was that of a figurehead with little actual authority, but he was used as a mediator to resolve league disagreements.[35] In the second half of the decade McGregor's failure to attend many committee meetings led to criticism from John Bentley, his successor as president. Bentley's criticism achieved the desired effect; from 1899 until his health deteriorated in 1910, McGregor seldom missed a meeting.[36] During this period McGregor was noted for his reserved nature. He was silent for large parts of committee meetings, but would contribute enthusiastically on the occasions he felt his input was necessary.[35]
Between 1888 and 1894 McGregor also served as chairman of The Football Association (the FA), English football's overall governing body, which had existed since 1863.[2] He became known as a football celebrity, writing a weekly column for the Birmingham Gazette and endorsing products such as footballs,[7][35] and a type of football boot which the manufacturer billed as the "McGregor lace-to-toe boot".[37] Though he held many different administrative posts in his lifetime, McGregor never played the sport competitively; his only on-pitch involvement was occasional goalkeeping during Aston Villa practices in the 1870s.[15]
[edit]Death and legacy

Although McGregor envisaged the League as a friendly union, within which clubs would share ticket revenues and work together in their mutual best interests, the immediate effect of its creation was that football came to be treated as a business for the first time, as opposed to something that players and officials simply regarded as a pastime.[11][22] All the clubs involved experienced significant increases in their turnover, which at Aston Villa, McGregor's own club, increased more than sixfold between 1889 and 1899.[11][22] The wages paid to players, however, remained low due to restrictions imposed by the FA, so clubs were able to use their increased profitability to build larger stadiums and accommodate ever larger crowds of spectators.[38] Although the League initially contained a small number of clubs, all of which were based in the northern half of the country, by the early years of the twentieth century it included clubs from all parts of England. At its peak nearly 100 clubs played in the Football League, and it remained the pre-eminent competition in English football until the 1990s, when the top clubs broke away to form the Premier League.[39] In keeping with McGregor's views on mutual support and co-operation, gate receipts were shared amongst the clubs until the 1980s, which helped to ensure that a select few wealthy clubs were not able to dominate the competition.[40] McGregor himself had little interest in the business aspect of football, and was adamant that the Football League should not challenge the longstanding authority of the FA.[11] The success of the Football League directly inspired the creation of similar competitions in other countries, beginning with Scotland, where the Scottish Football League was formed in 1890.[41]
In May 1910, McGregor was taken ill and later confined to a nursing home.[12] His condition worsened towards the end of 1911. His last public appearance was a committee meeting on 4 December,[37] and he underwent an operation on 19 December. However, after a brief improvement in his condition he relapsed and died the following day.[42] Although a devout Methodist,[12] he is buried in the grounds of a Church of England church, St. Mary's, in the Handsworth district of Birmingham, alongside his wife, who died in 1908.[1] McGregor is remembered as the "father of The Football League",[43] an Aston Villa legend, and a legend of football in general.[44]
Shortly before his death, the FA presented McGregor, who was at that time a vice-president of the association, with a long service medal.[7][45] After his death, Aston Villa dedicated a bed in the children's ward of one of Birmingham's hospitals in his honour, and the Birmingham County Football Association unveiled a commemorative drinking fountain, which is now preserved at Villa Park, current home of his former club.[12] In the modern era, Aston Villa selected him as one of the twelve inaugural members of its Hall of Fame,[14] and named a hospitality suite at Villa Park after him.[46] In 2008, the Aston Villa Supporters' Trust announced plans to further honour him with a bronze statue outside the stadium.[6][47] The statue will be displayed outside the Directors' Entrance of the Trinity Road Stand, and was unveiled on 28 November 2009.[48]
